# 05 — Prediction Model

## Goal
At each frame t, output P(shot in (t, t+H]) and P(goal in (t, t+H]).

## Labels
- `shot_within_H`: 1 if the attacking team shoots within H seconds after t.
- Default **H = 5 s**; also evaluate H = 3 s.
- Only frames in open play with a team in possession. Exclude dead-ball frames.
- Attacking team = `possession_team`; flip coordinates so it always attacks +x.
- Training uses provider `ball_state` and `possession_team` (02).

## Inference
- Predict only on frames where `ball_state` is not dead and `possession_team` is set; otherwise output null (the overlay holds or greys out the meter).
- `ball_state = null` counts as not dead, so vision gaps don't blank the meter. Report how often this happens.

## Leakage rules
- Inputs use frames `<= t` only.
- Split train/val/test **by match**.
- Report performance separately for lead times (see 07); a model that only fires 0.2 s before the shot is not useful.

## Models (build in order)
0. **Floor:** logistic regression on ball distance + angle to goal. Any model that can't beat this isn't learning anything.
1. **Baseline:** gradient boosting (LightGBM) on hand features — ball distance/angle to goal, defenders in shooting cone, carrier speed, pitch control near the box. This is the bar the GNNs must clear.
2. **Frame GNN:** one graph per frame. Nodes = players + ball (+ goals); node features = position, velocity, team, dynamic + profile features (04); edges = all pairs or k-nearest, edge features = distance, relative velocity. Built with `unravelsports` SoccerGraphConverter.
3. **Temporal GNN:** last 2–3 s of frames (at 10 Hz) through a GNN backbone, then a GRU/T-GCN over time. Follows the SoccerAI approach.

## xG model
### Feature rule
Every xG feature must be (a) computable at frame t from game state (02), before any shot happens, and (b) present in the training source. Anything only known once the shot is taken is out.

| Feature | Known at t? | StatsBomb 360 | Wyscout | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Distance, angle to goal | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Defenders in the shooting cone | Yes | Yes (freeze frame) | No | Yes |
| Goalkeeper position / distance off line | Yes | Yes (freeze frame) | No | Yes |
| Nearest defender distance (pressure) | Yes | Yes (freeze frame) | No | Yes |
| Body part (foot / head) | **No** | Yes | Yes | **No** |
| Shot technique (volley, lob, ...) | **No** | Yes | Partly | **No** |
| Play pattern (open play / set piece) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Filter only: train on open play, matching 05's labels |

### Training data
- **Primary: StatsBomb 360 open data.** 300 men's matches have 360 freeze frames (~7,500 shots, estimated at ~25/match; checked 2026-09-25). Freeze frames only include players visible on the broadcast, like our vision output.
- **Wyscout (defcon CSV):** location-only xG (distance + angle). A baseline and sanity check, not the production model.
- Convert StatsBomb coordinates (120 × 80 yards, origin top-left) to 02's meters.
- **Leakage:** if PFF World Cup 2022 matches are in any evaluation fold, drop StatsBomb's World Cup 2022 (the same 64 matches) from xG training.
- **Check calibration on our own data:** apply the xG model to SkillCorner shots at the shot frame and compare to the 61 goals (06). Report it; don't retrain on it.

### Combining with P(shot)
xG at the carrier's current position is an approximation. The shot usually happens later, from somewhere closer to goal. Build in order:
1. **v1: carrier position.** P(goal) = P(shot) × xG(ball carrier at t). Tends to underestimate P(goal) early in an attack, since the carrier is still far from goal. Measure how much by comparing to xG at the actual shot frame.
2. **v2: shooter-weighted.** If the node-level "who will shoot" head exists, P(goal) = Σ_i P(player i shoots) × xG(player i at t). Still uses positions at t, but covers runners who aren't on the ball.
- A direct P(goal within H) model is out: ~61 goals in 20 matches is far too few to train it.

## Class imbalance
- Weighted loss or focal loss; evaluate with PR-AUC, not accuracy.

## Acceptance criteria
- LightGBM baseline beats the distance + angle floor.
- Temporal GNN beats the LightGBM baseline on PR-AUC in grouped cross-validation (pooled out-of-fold, and on most folds), confirmed on the IDSSE external test set (see 07).
- Calibration error acceptable after (optional) temperature scaling.

## Open questions
- Predict "which player will shoot" as a node-level head too?
- Add uncertainty (MC dropout / Bayesian head, as in Goka et al. 2023)?
